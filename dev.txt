TESTING 101 
  TYPES OF AUTOMATED TESTING
UNIT TESTING is the testing of the individual building blocks of an application eg. classes, functions or components. These 'building blocks' are tested in isolation from other units. Any dependencies are MOCKED. These tests run in a short amount of time and make it easier to pin point failures. They are also relatively easier to write. 
INTEGRATION TESTS is the testing of a combination of units to make they work together. 
END-2-END TESTS is the testing of the entire application flow and ensuring it works as designed from start to finish. This involeves a real UI, backend database, real services etc. It also takes the longest and covers the most amount of code.This test may also have a cost implication as requests are being made to API's which may charge based on requests.
